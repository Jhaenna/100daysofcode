	<h1>Summer Style for Everyday Men</h1>
	<p>Jheanna highlight the key players in the summer 2022 fashion lineup in this blog post. (Did you catch the sports reference?)
	</p><br><br>
	<p>Men. We recognize them, adore them, and dress them. To be honest, there aren't enough mens fashion posts for the everyday guy! As a result, we created a guide that is easily adaptable and suitable for all lifestyles. You only need these 8 items in your closet to be SET!</p><br>
	<p><b>This one is for the men!</b></p>

	<h2>Bold Prints & Bright Colours</h2>
	<p>Although having basics in your closet is fine, there are times when you need to spice things up. The easiest ways to incorporate summer 2022 fashion trends into your wardrobe are with a bold print and a bright color. This is true for both tops and bottoms.</p>

    <h2>Neutral Pants</h2>
    <p>Follow this advice and avoid wearing denim in the summer; instead, opt for a neutral pant or chino. Some occasions or temperatures call for pants, and a slim fit beige, white, or earth toned pair is ideal.</p>

   <p>If that's not your thing, most brands offer an elastic synch at the ankle to dress the look down.</p>

   <h2>Mens Jewelry</h2>
   <p>Jewelry is not exclusive for women! There are so many brands, like Mejuri, who have created collections for men. For this trend, start small with a chain and then start integrating rings (or vice-versa). You will love it, we promise. </p>

   <h2>Utility Slides</h2>
   <p>Sandals are a key feature of summer, and we recommend that men wear them more often. Utility sandals like these are an excellent way to transition from the sport-slide to something more streetwear.</p>
